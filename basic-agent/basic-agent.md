# Basic Agentic AI

Create an Agent that supports agentic AI capabilities
and is able to easily access several different [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) servers 

Create a basic agent.  

Also create an MCP Client for the following capabilities:

## Agentic AI Agent Specification

### Core Features
- **Autonomous Decision Making**: The agent can make decisions and take actions without constant human intervention
- **Goal-Oriented Behavior**: Works towards specific objectives and can break down complex tasks
- **Learning & Adaptation**: Improves performance over time based on feedback and experience
- **Multi-Modal Capabilities**: Can process text, images, and other data types
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains context across conversations and sessions

### MCP Server Integration
The agent should connect to multiple MCP servers for enhanced capabilities:

1. **File System Server**: Access and manipulate files
2. **Git Server**: Version control operations - Setup access to the Remote Github MCP server : https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/
3. 
3. **Web Search Server**: Real-time information retrieval
4. **Database Server**: Data storage and retrieval
5. **API Server**: External service integration
6. **Code Execution Server**: Run and test code
7. **Documentation Server**: Access technical documentation

### Agent Architecture

```python
class AgenticAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.mcp_clients = {}
        self.memory = {}
        self.goals = []
        self.context = {}
        
    def connect_mcp_servers(self):
        # Initialize connections to various MCP servers
        pass
        
    def plan_and_execute(self, task):
        # Break down task into subtasks and execute
        pass
        
    def learn_from_feedback(self, feedback):
        # Update behavior based on feedback
        pass
```

### Implementation Requirements

1. **Python-based agent** with async capabilities
2. **MCP client library** integration
3. **Natural language processing** for task understanding
4. **Task planning and execution** framework
5. **Memory management** for context retention
6. **Error handling and recovery** mechanisms
7. **Logging and monitoring** capabilities

### Example Use Cases

- **Code Development**: Write, test, and deploy code
- **Data Analysis**: Process and analyze datasets
- **Content Creation**: Generate reports, documentation, and creative content
- **Problem Solving**: Debug issues and find solutions
- **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks
- **Research**: Gather and synthesize information

### Configuration

The agent should be configurable via:
- Environment variables
- Configuration files
- Runtime parameters
- MCP server endpoints

### Security Considerations

- Secure MCP server connections
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and resource management
- Audit logging for all actions
