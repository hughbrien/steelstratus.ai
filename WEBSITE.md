# Prompt for building webite.  


I want to do a complete redesign of the Steelstratus.com website
I want you to make it the most beautiful sections for Services and Founders. Use other components in the reference window as inspiration.
i.e. pick any website that is known for being great.
I want you to use those components as reference points for the general style, tone, and design.
Use creative freedom to make the most beautiful, dynamic, interactice, engaging, modern sleak, professional, stunning, beautiful UI card ever. 
Think of something users would want to use and gain joy from interacting with.
Really go above and beyond to make something incredible for me.
